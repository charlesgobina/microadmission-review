## Tribute Page Review 
This project is a review of my tribute page project I worked on during the Microverse Trial. I reviewed this project in
order to apply my knowledge on HTML semantics and CSS selectors in correcting the HTML and CSS to meetup with the standard.
Working on this project also tested my knowledge on Gitflow.
